# Interesting essays

I come across numerous interesting essays or journal articles, mostly hosted on University websites but the typesetting (in my highly opinionated personal opinion) is often appalling. Taking this opportunity to experiment with different layout options and web typesetting techniques.

All essays will be linked to their original sources.

As an aside, a number of people excel at typesetting on the web, one of my favourites in this department is [Robin Rendle](https://www.robinrendle.com/essays/) (see [Systems, Mistakes, and the Sea](https://www.robinrendle.com/essays/systems-mistakes-and-the-sea) as a great example of his excellent work).

*Update: have expanded this to include published short stories not because they are not typeset well, I just want a place to store them* ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Local development

1. `git clone git@github.com:huijing/interesting-essays.git`
2. `npm install`
3. `gulp`

- Styles go in the styles.scss file, and will be compiled by Gulp
- Scripts go into the js folder, and will be concatenated by Gulp
