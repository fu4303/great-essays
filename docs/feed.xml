&lt;p&gt;Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beautya beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--BERTRAND RUSSELL, Study of Mathematics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a story about two friends, who were classmates in high school, talking about their jobs. One of them became a statistician and was working on population trends. He showed a reprint to his former classmate. The reprint started, as usual, with the Gaussian distribution and the statistician explained to his former classmate the meaning of the symbols for the actual population, for the average population, and so on. His classmate was a bit incredulous and was not quite sure whether the statistician was pulling his leg. &amp;quot;How can you know that?&amp;quot; was his query. &amp;quot;And what is this symbol here?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Oh,&amp;quot; said the statistician, &amp;quot;this is pi.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;What is that?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The ratio of the circumference of the circle to its diameter.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Well, now you are pushing your joke too far,&amp;quot; said the classmate, &amp;quot;surely the population has nothing to do with the circumference of the circle.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, we are inclined to smile about the simplicity of the classmate&#39;s approach. Nevertheless, when I heard this story, I had to admit to an eerie feeling because, surely, the reaction of the classmate betrayed only plain common sense. I was even more confused when, not many days later, someone came to me and expressed his bewilderment [1 The remark to be quoted was made by F. Werner when he was a student in Princeton.] with the fact that we make a rather narrow selection when choosing the data on which we test our theories. &amp;quot;How do we know that, if we made a theory which focuses its attention on phenomena we disregard and disregards some of the phenomena now commanding our attention, that we could not build another theory which has little in common with the present one but which, nevertheless, explains just as many phenomena as the present theory?&amp;quot; It has to be admitted that we have no definite evidence that there is no such theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preceding two stories illustrate the two main points which are the subjects of the present discourse. The first point is that mathematical concepts turn up in entirely unexpected connections. Moreover, they often permit an unexpectedly close and accurate description of the phenomena in these connections. Secondly, just because of this circumstance, and because we do not understand the reasons of their usefulness, we cannot know whether a theory formulated in terms of mathematical concepts is uniquely appropriate. We are in a position similar to that of a man who was provided with a bunch of keys and who, having to open several doors in succession, always hit on the right key on the first or second trial. He became skeptical concerning the uniqueness of the coordination between keys and doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of what will be said on these questions will not be new; it has probably occurred to most scientists in one form or another. My principal aim is to illuminate it from several sides. The first point is that the enormous usefulness of mathematics in the natural sciences is something bordering on the mysterious and that there is no rational explanation for it. Second, it is just this uncanny usefulness of mathematical concepts that raises the question of the uniqueness of our physical theories. In order to establish the first point, that mathematics plays an unreasonably important role in physics, it will be useful to say a few words on the question, &amp;quot;What is mathematics?&amp;quot;, then, &amp;quot;What is physics?&amp;quot;, then, how mathematics enters physical theories, and last, why the success of mathematics in its role in physics appears so baffling. Much less will be said on the second point: the uniqueness of the theories of physics. A proper answer to this question would require elaborate experimental and theoretical work which has not been undertaken to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Mathematics?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody once said that philosophy is the misuse of a terminology which was invented just for this purpose. [2 This statement is quoted here from W. Dubislav&#39;s Die Philosophie der Mathematik in der Gegenwart (Berlin: Junker and Dunnhaupt Verlag, 1932), p. 1.] In the same vein, I would say that mathematics is the science of skillful operations with concepts and rules invented just for this purpose. The principal emphasis is on the invention of concepts. Mathematics would soon run out of interesting theorems if these had to be formulated in terms of the concepts which already appear in the axioms. Furthermore, whereas it is unquestionably true that the concepts of elementary mathematics and particularly elementary geometry were formulated to describe entities which are directly suggested by the actual world, the same does not seem to be true of the more advanced concepts, in particular the concepts which play such an important role in physics. Thus, the rules for operations with pairs of numbers are obviously designed to give the same results as the operations with fractions which we first learned without reference to &amp;quot;pairs of numbers.&amp;quot; The rules for the operations with sequences, that is, with irrational numbers, still belong to the category of rules which were determined so as to reproduce rules for the operations with quantities which were already known to us. Most more advanced mathematical concepts, such as complex numbers, algebras, linear operators, Borel setsãand this list could be continued almost indefinitelyãwere so devised that they are apt subjects on which the mathematician can demonstrate his ingenuity and sense of formal beauty. In fact, the definition of these concepts, with a realization that interesting and ingenious considerations could be applied to them, is the first demonstration of the ingeniousness of the mathematician who defines them. The depth of thought which goes into the formulation of the mathematical concepts is later justified by the skill with which these concepts are used. The great mathematician fully, almost ruthlessly, exploits the domain of permissible reasoning and skirts the impermissible. That his recklessness does not lead him into a morass of contradictions is a miracle in itself: certainly it is hard to believe that our reasoning power was brought, by Darwin&#39;s process of natural selection, to the perfection which it seems to possess. However, this is not our present subject. The principal point which will have to be recalled later is that the mathematician could formulate only a handful of interesting theorems without defining concepts beyond those contained in the axioms and that the concepts outside those contained in the axioms are defined with a view of permitting ingenious logical operations which appeal to our aesthetic sense both as operations and also in their results of great generality and simplicity. [3 M. Polanyi, in his Personal Knowledge (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1958), says: &amp;quot;All these difficulties are but consequences of our refusal to see that mathematics cannot be defined without acknowledging its most obvious feature: namely, that it is interesting&amp;quot; (p 188).]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complex numbers provide a particularly striking example for the foregoing. Certainly, nothing in our experience suggests the introduction of these quantities. Indeed, if a mathematician is asked to justify his interest in complex numbers, he will point, with some indignation, to the many beautiful theorems in the theory of equations, of power series, and of analytic functions in general, which owe their origin to the introduction of complex numbers. The mathematician is not willing to give up his interest in these most beautiful accomplishments of his genius. [4 The reader may be interested, in this connection, in Hilbert&#39;s rather testy remarks about intuitionism which &amp;quot;seeks to break up and to disfigure mathematics,&amp;quot; Abh. Math. Sem., Univ. Hamburg, 157 (1922), or Gesammelte Werke (Berlin: Springer, 1935), p. 188.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Physics?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physicist is interested in discovering the laws of inanimate nature. In order to understand this statement, it is necessary to analyze the concept, &amp;quot;law of nature.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world around us is of baffling complexity and the most obvious fact about it is that we cannot predict the future. Although the joke attributes only to the optimist the view that the future is uncertain, the optimist is right in this case: the future is unpredictable. It is, as Schrodinger has remarked, a miracle that in spite of the baffling complexity of the world, certain regularities in the events could be discovered. One such regularity, discovered by Galileo, is that two rocks, dropped at the same time from the same height, reach the ground at the same time. The laws of nature are concerned with such regularities. Galileo&#39;s regularity is a prototype of a large class of regularities. It is a surprising regularity for three reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first reason that it is surprising is that it is true not only in Pisa, and in Galileo&#39;s time, it is true everywhere on the Earth, was always true, and will always be true. This property of the regularity is a recognized invariance property and, as I had occasion to point out some time ago, without invariance principles similar to those implied in the preceding generalization of Galileo&#39;s observation, physics would not be possible. The second surprising feature is that the regularity which we are discussing is independent of so many conditions which could have an effect on it. It is valid no matter whether it rains or not, whether the experiment is carried out in a room or from the Leaning Tower, no matter whether the person who drops the rocks is a man or a woman. It is valid even if the two rocks are dropped, simultaneously and from the same height, by two different people. There are, obviously, innumerable other conditions which are all immaterial from the point of view of the validity of Galileo&#39;s regularity. The irrelevancy of so many circumstances which could play a role in the phenomenon observed has also been called an invariance. However, this invariance is of a different character from the preceding one since it cannot be formulated as a general principle. The exploration of the conditions which do, and which do not, influence a phenomenon is part of the early experimental exploration of a field. It is the skill and ingenuity of the experimenter which show him phenomena which depend on a relatively narrow set of relatively easily realizable and reproducible conditions. [5 See, in this connection, the graphic essay of M. Deutsch, Daedalus 87, 86 (1958). A. Shimony has called my attention to a similar passage in C. S. Peirce&#39;s Essays in the Philosophy of Science (New York: The Liberal Arts Press, 1957), p. 237.] In the present case, Galileo&#39;s restriction of his observations to relatively heavy bodies was the most important step in this regard. Again, it is true that if there were no phenomena which are independent of all but a manageably small set of conditions, physics would be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preceding two points, though highly significant from the point of view of the philosopher, are not the ones which surprised Galileo most, nor do they contain a specific law of nature. The law of nature is contained in the statement that the length of time which it takes for a heavy object to fall from a given height is independent of the size, material, and shape of the body which drops. In the framework of Newton&#39;s second &amp;quot;law,&amp;quot; this amounts to the statement that the gravitational force which acts on the falling body is proportional to its mass but independent of the size, material, and shape of the body which falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preceding discussion is intended to remind us, first, that it is not at all natural that &amp;quot;laws of nature&amp;quot; exist, much less that man is able to discover them. [6 E. Schrodinger, in his What Is Life? (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1945), p. 31, says that this second miracle may well be beyond human understanding.] The present writer had occasion, some time ago, to call attention to the succession of layers of &amp;quot;laws of nature,&amp;quot; each layer containing more general and more encompassing laws than the previous one and its discovery constituting a deeper penetration into the structure of the universe than the layers recognized before. However, the point which is most significant in the present context is that all these laws of nature contain, in even their remotest consequences, only a small part of our knowledge of the inanimate world. All the laws of nature are conditional statements which permit a prediction of some future events on the basis of the knowledge of the present, except that some aspects of the present state of the world, in practice the overwhelming majority of the determinants of the present state of the world, are irrelevant from the point of view of the prediction. The irrelevancy is meant in the sense of the second point in the discussion of Galileo&#39;s theorem. [7 The writer feels sure that it is unnecessary to mention that Galileo&#39;s theorem, as given in the text, does not exhaust the content of Galileo&#39;s observations in connection with the laws of freely falling bodies.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As regards the present state of the world, such as the existence of the earth on which we live and on which Galileo&#39;s experiments were performed, the existence of the sun and of all our surroundings, the laws of nature are entirely silent. It is in consonance with this, first, that the laws of nature can be used to predict future events only under exceptional circumstancesãwhen all the relevant determinants of the present state of the world are known. It is also in consonance with this that the construction of machines, the functioning of which he can foresee, constitutes the most spectacular accomplishment of the physicist. In these machines, the physicist creates a situation in which all the relevant coordinates are known so that the behavior of the machine can be predicted. Radars and nuclear reactors are examples of such machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principal purpose of the preceding discussion is to point out that the laws of nature are all conditional statements and they relate only to a very small part of our knowledge of the world. Thus, classical mechanics, which is the best known prototype of a physical theory, gives the second derivatives of the positional coordinates of all bodies, on the basis of the knowledge of the positions, etc., of these bodies. It gives no information on the existence, the present positions, or velocities of these bodies. It should be mentioned, for the sake of accuracy, that we discovered about thirty years ago that even the conditional statements cannot be entirely precise: that the conditional statements are probability laws which enable us only to place intelligent bets on future properties of the inanimate world, based on the knowledge of the present state. They do not allow us to make categorical statements, not even categorical statements conditional on the present state of the world. The probabilistic nature of the &amp;quot;laws of nature&amp;quot; manifests itself in the case of machines also, and can be verified, at least in the case of nuclear reactors, if one runs them at very low power. However, the additional limitation of the scope of the laws of nature which follows from their probabilistic nature will play no role in the rest of the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Role of Mathematics in Physical Theories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having refreshed our minds as to the essence of mathematics and physics, we should be in a better position to review the role of mathematics in physical theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, we do use mathematics in everyday physics to evaluate the results of the laws of nature, to apply the conditional statements to the particular conditions which happen to prevail or happen to interest us. In order that this be possible, the laws of nature must already be formulated in mathematical language. However, the role of evaluating the consequences of already established theories is not the most important role of mathematics in physics. Mathematics, or, rather, applied mathematics, is not so much the master of the situation in this function: it is merely serving as a tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematics does play, however, also a more sovereign role in physics. This was already implied in the statement, made when discussing the role of applied mathematics, that the laws of nature must have been formulated in the language of mathematics to be an object for the use of applied mathematics. The statement that the laws of nature are written in the language of mathematics was properly made three hundred years ago;[8 It is attributed to Galileo] it is now more true than ever before. In order to show the importance which mathematical concepts possess in the formulation of the laws of physics, let us recall, as an example, the axioms of quantum mechanics as formulated, explicitly, by the great physicist, Dirac. There are two basic concepts in quantum mechanics: states and observables. The states are vectors in Hilbert space, the observables self-adjoint operators on these vectors. The possible values of the observations are the characteristic values of the operatorsãbut we had better stop here lest we engage in a listing of the mathematical concepts developed in the theory of linear operators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true, of course, that physics chooses certain mathematical concepts for the formulation of the laws of nature, and surely only a fraction of all mathematical concepts is used in physics. It is true also that the concepts which were chosen were not selected arbitrarily from a listing of mathematical terms but were developed, in many if not most cases, independently by the physicist and recognized then as having been conceived before by the mathematician. It is not true, however, as is so often stated, that this had to happen because mathematics uses the simplest possible concepts and these were bound to occur in any formalism. As we saw before, the concepts of mathematics are not chosen for their conceptual simplicityeven sequences of pairs of numbers are far from being the simplest conceptsbut for their amenability to clever manipulations and to striking, brilliant arguments. Let us not forget that the Hilbert space of quantum mechanics is the complex Hilbert space, with a Hermitean scalar product. Surely to the unpreoccupied mind, complex numbers are far from natural or simple and they cannot be suggested by physical observations. Furthermore, the use of complex numbers is in this case not a calculational trick of applied mathematics but comes close to being a necessity in the formulation of the laws of quantum mechanics. Finally, it now begins to appear that not only complex numbers but so-called analytic functions are destined to play a decisive role in the formulation of quantum theory. I am referring to the rapidly developing theory of dispersion relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to avoid the impression that a miracle confronts us here, quite comparable in its striking nature to the miracle that the human mind can string a thousand arguments together without getting itself into contradictions, or to the two miracles of the existence of laws of nature and of the human mind&#39;s capacity to divine them. The observation which comes closest to an explanation for the mathematical concepts&#39; cropping up in physics which I know is Einstein&#39;s statement that the only physical theories which we are willing to accept are the beautiful ones. It stands to argue that the concepts of mathematics, which invite the exercise of so much wit, have the quality of beauty. However, Einstein&#39;s observation can at best explain properties of theories which we are willing to believe and has no reference to the intrinsic accuracy of the theory. We shall, therefore, turn to this latter question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is the success of physical theories truly surprising?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A possible explanation of the physicist&#39;s use of mathematics to formulate his laws of nature is that he is a somewhat irresponsible person. As a result, when he finds a connection between two quantities which resembles a connection well-known from mathematics, he will jump at the conclusion that the connection is that discussed in mathematics simply because he does not know of any other similar connection. It is not the intention of the present discussion to refute the charge that the physicist is a somewhat irresponsible person. Perhaps he is. However, it is important to point out that the mathematical formulation of the physicist&#39;s often crude experience leads in an uncanny number of cases to an amazingly accurate description of a large class of phenomena. This shows that the mathematical language has more to commend it than being the only language which we can speak; it shows that it is, in a very real sense, the correct language. Let us consider a few examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first example is the oft-quoted one of planetary motion. The laws of falling bodies became rather well established as a result of experiments carried out principally in Italy. These experiments could not be very accurate in the sense in which we understand accuracy today partly because of the effect of air resistance and partly because of the impossibility, at that time, to measure short time intervals. Nevertheless, it is not surprising that, as a result of their studies, the Italian natural scientists acquired a familiarity with the ways in which objects travel through the atmosphere. It was Newton who then brought the law of freely falling objects into relation with the motion of the moon, noted that the parabola of the thrown rock&#39;s path on the earth and the circle of the moon&#39;s path in the sky are particular cases of the same mathematical object of an ellipse, and postulated the universal law of gravitation on the basis of a single, and at that time very approximate, numerical coincidence. Philosophically, the law of gravitation as formulated by Newton was repugnant to his time and to himself. Empirically, it was based on very scanty observations. The mathematical language in which it was formulated contained the concept of a second derivative and those of us who have tried to draw an osculating circle to a curve know that the second derivative is not a very immediate concept. The law of gravity which Newton reluctantly established and which he could verify with an accuracy of about 4% has proved to be accurate to less than a ten thousandth of a per cent and became so closely associated with the idea of absolute accuracy that only recently did physicists become again bold enough to inquire into the limitations of its accuracy. [9 See, for instance, R. H. Dicke, Am. Sci., 25 (1959).] Certainly, the example of Newton&#39;s law, quoted over and over again, must be mentioned first as a monumental example of a law, formulated in terms which appear simple to the mathematician, which has proved accurate beyond all reasonable expectations. Let us just recapitulate our thesis on this example: first, the law, particularly since a second derivative appears in it, is simple only to the mathematician, not to common sense or to non-mathematically-minded freshmen; second, it is a conditional law of very limited scope. It explains nothing about the earth which attracts Galileo&#39;s rocks, or about the circular form of the moon&#39;s orbit, or about the planets of the sun. The explanation of these initial conditions is left to the geologist and the astronomer, and they have a hard time with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second example is that of ordinary, elementary quantum mechanics. This originated when Max Born noticed that some rules of computation, given by Heisenberg, were formally identical with the rules of computation with matrices, established a long time before by mathematicians. Born, Jordan, and Heisenberg then proposed to replace by matrices the position and momentum variables of the equations of classical mechanics. They applied the rules of matrix mechanics to a few highly idealized problems and the results were quite satisfactory. However, there was, at that time, no rational evidence that their matrix mechanics would prove correct under more realistic conditions. Indeed, they say &amp;quot;if the mechanics as here proposed should already be correct in its essential traits.&amp;quot; As a matter of fact, the first application of their mechanics to a realistic problem, that of the hydrogen atom, was given several months later, by Pauli. This application gave results in agreement with experience. This was satisfactory but still understandable because Heisenberg&#39;s rules of calculation were abstracted from problems which included the old theory of the hydrogen atom. The miracle occurred only when matrix mechanics, or a mathematically equivalent theory, was applied to problems for which Heisenberg&#39;s calculating rules were meaningless. Heisenberg&#39;s rules presupposed that the classical equations of motion had solutions with certain periodicity properties; and the equations of motion of the two electrons of the helium atom, or of the even greater number of electrons of heavier atoms, simply do not have these properties, so that Heisenberg&#39;s rules cannot be applied to these cases. Nevertheless, the calculation of the lowest energy level of helium, as carried out a few months ago by Kinoshita at Cornell and by Bazley at the Bureau of Standards, agrees with the experimental data within the accuracy of the observations, which is one part in ten million. Surely in this case we &amp;quot;got something out&amp;quot; of the equations that we did not put in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true of the qualitative characteristics of the &amp;quot;complex spectra,&amp;quot; that is, the spectra of heavier atoms. I wish to recall a conversation with Jordan, who told me, when the qualitative features of the spectra were derived, that a disagreement of the rules derived from quantum mechanical theory and the rules established by empirical research would have provided the last opportunity to make a change in the framework of matrix mechanics. In other words, Jordan felt that we would have been, at least temporarily, helpless had an unexpected disagreement occurred in the theory of the helium atom. This was, at that time, developed by Kellner and by Hilleraas. The mathematical formalism was too dear and unchangeable so that, had the miracle of helium which was mentioned before not occurred, a true crisis would have arisen. Surely, physics would have overcome that crisis in one way or another. It is true, on the other hand, that physics as we know it today would not be possible without a constant recurrence of miracles similar to the one of the helium atom, which is perhaps the most striking miracle that has occurred in the course of the development of elementary quantum mechanics, but by far not the only one. In fact, the number of analogous miracles is limited, in our view, only by our willingness to go after more similar ones. Quantum mechanics had, nevertheless, many almost equally striking successes which gave us the firm conviction that it is, what we call, correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last example is that of quantum electrodynamics, or the theory of the Lamb shift. Whereas Newton&#39;s theory of gravitation still had obvious connections with experience, experience entered the formulation of matrix mechanics only in the refined or sublimated form of Heisenberg&#39;s prescriptions. The quantum theory of the Lamb shift, as conceived by Bethe and established by Schwinger, is a purely mathematical theory and the only direct contribution of experiment was to show the existence of a measurable effect. The agreement with calculation is better than one part in a thousand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preceding three examples, which could be multiplied almost indefinitely, should illustrate the appropriateness and accuracy of the mathematical formulation of the laws of nature in terms of concepts chosen for their manipulability, the &amp;quot;laws of nature&amp;quot; being of almost fantastic accuracy but of strictly limited scope. I propose to refer to the observation which these examples illustrate as the empirical law of epistemology. Together with the laws of invariance of physical theories, it is an indispensable foundation of these theories. Without the laws of invariance the physical theories could have been given no foundation of fact; if the empirical law of epistemology were not correct, we would lack the encouragement and reassurance which are emotional necessities, without which the &amp;quot;laws of nature&amp;quot; could not have been successfully explored. Dr. R. G. Sachs, with whom I discussed the empirical law of epistemology, called it an article of faith of the theoretical physicist, and it is surely that. However, what he called our article of faith can be well supported by actual examplesãmany examples in addition to the three which have been mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The uniqueness of the theories of Physics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The empirical nature of the preceding observation seems to me to be self-evident. It surely is not a &amp;quot;necessity of thought&amp;quot; and it should not be necessary, in order to prove this, to point to the fact that it applies only to a very small part of our knowledge of the inanimate world. It is absurd to believe that the existence of mathematically simple expressions for the second derivative of the position is self-evident, when no similar expressions for the position itself or for the velocity exist. It is therefore surprising how readily the wonderful gift contained in the empirical law of epistemology was taken for granted. The ability of the human mind to form a string of 1000 conclusions and still remain &amp;quot;right,&amp;quot; which was mentioned before, is a similar gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every empirical law has the disquieting quality that one does not know its limitations. We have seen that there are regularities in the events in the world around us which can be formulated in terms of mathematical concepts with an uncanny accuracy. There are, on the other hand, aspects of the world concerning which we do not believe in the existence of any accurate regularities. We call these initial conditions. The question which presents itself is whether the different regularities, that is, the various laws of nature which will be discovered, will fuse into a single consistent unit, or at least asymptotically approach such a fusion. Alternatively, it is possible that there always will be some laws of nature which have nothing in common with each other. At present, this is true, for instance, of the laws of heredity and of physics. It is even possible that some of the laws of nature will be in conflict with each other in their implications, but each convincing enough in its own domain so that we may not be willing to abandon any of them. We may resign ourselves to such a state of affairs or our interest in clearing up the conflict between the various theories may fade out. We may lose interest in the &amp;quot;ultimate truth,&amp;quot; that is, in a picture which is a consistent fusion into a single unit of the little pictures, formed on the various aspects of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be useful to illustrate the alternatives by an example. We now have, in physics, two theories of great power and interest: the theory of quantum phenomena and the theory of relativity. These two theories have their roots in mutually exclusive groups of phenomena. Relativity theory applies to macroscopic bodies, such as stars. The event of coincidence, that is, in ultimate analysis of collision, is the primitive event in the theory of relativity and defines a point in space-time, or at least would define a point if the colliding panicles were infinitely small. Quantum theory has its roots in the microscopic world and, from its point of view, the event of coincidence, or of collision, even if it takes place between particles of no spatial extent, is not primitive and not at all sharply isolated in space-time. The two theories operate with different mathematical conceptsãthe four dimensional Riemann space and the infinite dimensional Hilbert space, respectively. So far, the two theories could not be united, that is, no mathematical formulation exists to which both of these theories are approximations. All physicists believe that a union of the two theories is inherently possible and that we shall find it. Nevertheless, it is possible also to imagine that no union of the two theories can be found. This example illustrates the two possibilities, of union and of conflict, mentioned before, both of which are conceivable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to obtain an indication as to which alternative to expect ultimately, we can pretend to be a little more ignorant than we are and place ourselves at a lower level of knowledge than we actually possess. If we can find a fusion of our theories on this lower level of intelligence, we can confidently expect that we will find a fusion of our theories also at our real level of intelligence. On the other hand, if we would arrive at mutually contradictory theories at a somewhat lower level of knowledge, the possibility of the permanence of conflicting theories cannot be excluded for ourselves either. The level of knowledge and ingenuity is a continuous variable and it is unlikely that a relatively small variation of this continuous variable changes the attainable picture of the world from inconsistent to consistent. [10 This passage was written after a great deal of hesitation. The writer is convinced that it is useful, in epistemological discussions, to abandon the idealization that the level of human intelligence has a singular position on an absolute scale. In some cases it may even be useful to consider the attainment which is possible at the level of the intelligence of some other species. However, the writer also realizes that his thinking along the lines indicated in the text was too brief and not subject to sufficient critical appraisal to be reliable.] Considered from this point of view, the fact that some of the theories which we know to be false give such amazingly accurate results is an adverse factor. Had we somewhat less knowledge, the group of phenomena which these &amp;quot;false&amp;quot; theories explain would appear to us to be large enough to &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; these theories. However, these theories are considered to be &amp;quot;false&amp;quot; by us just for the reason that they are, in ultimate analysis, incompatible with more encompassing pictures and, if sufficiently many such false theories are discovered, they are bound to prove also to be in conflict with each other. Similarly, it is possible that the theories, which we consider to be &amp;quot;proved&amp;quot; by a number of numerical agreements which appears to be large enough for us, are false because they are in conflict with a possible more encompassing theory which is beyond our means of discovery. If this were true, we would have to expect conflicts between our theories as soon as their number grows beyond a certain point and as soon as they cover a sufficiently large number of groups of phenomena. In contrast to the article of faith of the theoretical physicist mentioned before, this is the nightmare of the theorist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us consider a few examples of &amp;quot;false&amp;quot; theories which give, in view of their falseness, alarmingly accurate descriptions of groups of phenomena. With some goodwill, one can dismiss some of the evidence which these examples provide. The success of Bohr&#39;s early and pioneering ideas on the atom was always a rather narrow one and the same applies to Ptolemy&#39;s epicycles. Our present vantage point gives an accurate description of all phenomena which these more primitive theories can describe. The same is not true any longer of the so-called free-electron theory, which gives a marvelously accurate picture of many, if not most, properties of metals, semiconductors, and insulators. In particular, it explains the fact, never properly understood on the basis of the &amp;quot;real theory,&amp;quot; that insulators show a specific resistance to electricity which may be 1026 times greater than that of metals. In fact, there is no experimental evidence to show that the resistance is not infinite under the conditions under which the free-electron theory would lead us to expect an infinite resistance. Nevertheless, we are convinced that the free-electron theory is a crude approximation which should be replaced, in the description of all phenomena concerning solids, by a more accurate picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If viewed from our real vantage point, the situation presented by the free-electron theory is irritating but is not likely to forebode any inconsistencies which are unsurmountable for us. The free-electron theory raises doubts as to how much we should trust numerical agreement between theory and experiment as evidence for the correctness of the theory. We are used to such doubts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A much more difficult and confusing situation would arise if we could, some day, establish a theory of the phenomena of consciousness, or of biology, which would be as coherent and convincing as our present theories of the inanimate world. Mendel&#39;s laws of inheritance and the subsequent work on genes may well form the beginning of such a theory as far as biology is concerned. Furthermore,, it is quite possible that an abstract argument can be found which shows that there is a conflict between such a theory and the accepted principles of physics. The argument could be of such abstract nature that it might not be possible to resolve the conflict, in favor of one or of the other theory, by an experiment. Such a situation would put a heavy strain on our faith in our theories and on our belief in the reality of the concepts which we form. It would give us a deep sense of frustration in our search for what I called &amp;quot;the ultimate truth.&amp;quot; The reason that such a situation is conceivable is that, fundamentally, we do not know why our theories work so well. Hence, their accuracy may not prove their truth and consistency. Indeed, it is this writer&#39;s belief that something rather akin to the situation which was described above exists if the present laws of heredity and of physics are confronted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me end on a more cheerful note. The miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. We should be grateful for it and hope that it will remain valid in future research and that it will extend, for better or for worse, to our pleasure, even though perhaps also to our bafflement, to wide branches of learning.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Whimsy Of The World</title>
    <link href="https://www.chenhuijing.com/interesting-essays/a-whimsy-of-the-world/"/>
    <updated>2020-02-17T08:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.chenhuijing.com/interesting-essays/a-whimsy-of-the-world/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For as long as the town of Aurora could remember, Ellie Watson had been a spirited sort. On her way to the general store to pick up some safety pins for her mother, Ellie could easily take a left instead of a right, and end up on the banks of the Tanner River throwing stones at the silvery shadows of trout. And while getting dressed for the Sunday social, she could suddenly put on her brother’s overalls instead of her new yellow dress – despite her brother being four years older and two inches taller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a shake of the head, Aunt Betty from Missouri liked to say that Ellie was “contrary”, by which she meant that Ellie was predisposed to do the opposite of whatever she’d been asked. But that wasn’t quite fair. For Ellie wasn’t disinclined to do what she was told. It’s just that when the moment came to do a particular thing, she was often inclined to do something else altogether. In fact, that Ellie did not always do what she’d been told, generally came as much as a surprise to Ellie as to anyone else. Because having been asked to do a particular thing, up until the very last moment, Ellie had every intention of doing it – so help her, God, cross her heart and hope to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, Ellie Watson was her own person. And to speculate on why she did what she did when she did it, one might just as well wonder why a monarch butterfly, having flown all the way from Mexico to Nebraska in the month of May, happens to land on one flower instead of another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one day in September 1936, after a particularly tedious instruction in grammar (dealing with the suitable uses of the past participle), as Ellie and her classmates were writing letters to their pen pals in England, Ellie suddenly lost her whimsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, she could almost pinpoint the exact moment it had happened. For having signed and sealed her letter, when Ellie went to place the stamp on the envelope, she did so in the upper right-hand corner, even though – as Marvin Eddlesby, the longstanding postmaster of the Aurora post office, could personally attest – Ellie generally chose to place her stamps in one of the other three corners on the face of an envelope and, upon occasion, had even been known to place it on the back! But as I say, on this particular day, when Ellie leaned over the envelope with the appropriate postage in hand, it suddenly seemed to her that there was no more sensible spot for the affixing of a stamp than above and to the right of the address. So, that’s where she affixed it – with two quick thumps of the fist, no less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just like that, she was a girl without a whim.
How To Travel Alone – And Love It&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days that followed, friends and family alike took notice of the transformation. Suddenly, in any given situation, Ellie was prone to do exactly what any well-behaved child would do in a similar situation. And what was even more surprising, Ellie seemed to do so without the slightest hesitation or remorse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, it would take an entire department of philosophy to write you a treatise on the difference between that which seems and that which is, but in this case, no such distinction needed to be made. For Ellie felt no hesitation or remorse. Since the affixing of the stamp, it had seemed perfectly natural to Ellie that one should make one’s bed in the morning, arrive at school on time, remain attentive in class, see to one’s chores in the afternoon, clear one’s plate after supper, and brush one’s teeth before bed. After all, hadn’t these practices been carefully fashioned in ages past and handed down from generation to generation because experience had taught that to follow them step by step inevitably led to a life of health and happiness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That all of this should be so, suddenly seemed as clear to Ellie as the fact that if you plotted two dots on an axis using the formula y=2x+2 and then connected them, you would initiate a line that anticipated all the other dots which that formula would dictate from here into eternity. Or, if you have allowed your memory of basic mathematics to lapse, suffice it to say that with the affixing of the stamp, Ellie had taken her first step on that path which is well-marked, well-trodden and well-advised – much to the satisfaction of her parents, her pastor and her principal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Months pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the months of summer, you understand, in which a single day seems to expand in every direction simultaneously, allowing one adventure to unfold into another without the slightest awareness of time. Rather, these were the months of autumn, those months in which the progress of the minutes was marked by the buzz of the alarm clock, the honk of the school bus, the clang of the bells in the schoolhouse and the whistles of the coach in the gym – in other words, by all those musical notes that decisively end one phase of our day only to usher us without patience or ceremony into the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you well might imagine, these clamorous sounds had often escaped Ellie’s attention in autumns past. When the school bus honked or the school bells clanged, the old Ellie might easily have failed to notice because she was too busy admiring all the fiery colours unleashed by the season upon the branches of the maples and elms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what with her new attentiveness to the daily ringing and dinging, the new Ellie hardly had time to notice the turning of the leaves before she was raking them off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thus might have been the progress of Ellie’s life from season to season and year to year, up two and over one, henceforth and thenceforth, ashes to ashes and dust to dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the 12th of December, as Ellie sat at her kitchen table reviewing her vocabulary words while eating a bowl of Corn Crispies, her attention was drawn to the three chimes from the wireless that signalled the beginning of the morning news. The lead story? On the preceding afternoon, King Edward VIII had abdicated his throne for the love of Wallis Simpson. Transmitting live from London, the American correspondent proceeded with his breathless account:
From the White Cliffs of Dover to the halls of Parliament, it has been no secret that since his ascension to the throne, King Edward has struggled with how to honour his duty to England on the one hand, and his love for the American divorcée on the other.
When the Prime Minister made it clear to the 42-year-old king that no marriage to Mrs Simpson could be countenanced, all evidence seemed to suggest that Edward had resigned himself to putting his torrid affair behind him in service of the crown.
But on Wednesday, at approximately 3pm Greenwich Mean Time, having just returned from an inspection of the royal guard, as Edward stood before his mirror in full regalia, he apparently turned to his trusted valet and said with a hint of surprise: “Prentice, my good man, instead of having tea with the bishop this afternoon, I think I shall give up the throne.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon hearing which, our heroine dropped her spoon. For in the suddenness of the King’s decision, Ellie had recognised the handiwork of her whimsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, as surprising as that may seem, Ellie was not mistaken…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that tedious grammar lesson back in September, Ellie’s whimsy was feeling unusually restless. Not only had the various rules governing the use of the past participle seemed especially burdensome, Miss Penniworth had informed the class that after they had written to their pen pals, they would be shifting their attention to the memorisation of another Shakespearean sonnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, from the whimsy’s point of view, the writing of romantic verses seemed a perfectly sensible use of time. And to have someone read to you the romantic verses which they had written on your behalf was even better! But to spend an afternoon memorising a sonnet that someone long ago had written to somebody else, this seemed to miss the point of sonnet-writing altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s really just too much,” thought the whimsy with his head in his hands. And on something of an impulse, after Ellie had finished writing to her pen pal, he slipped himself into the envelope, game for a change of scenery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be lying were I to suggest that in the following days Ellie’s whimsy felt no regrets. After all, in the 1930s it took several weeks for a letter to find its way from a farmhouse in Nebraska to a townhouse in Belgravia, what with having to sail across the Atlantic and such. Hundreds of hours of the whimsy’s initial independence were spent folded inside an envelope, stuffed into a mailbag and buried at the bottom of a hold.
A Place Less Travelled: Losinj, Croatia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What have I done?” the whimsy reasonably asked himself, as he travelled at 30 knots over mid-Atlantic swells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon his arrival in London, Ellie’s whimsy had new cause for second thoughts. For while Ellie’s pen pal, Abigail Abernathy, turned out to be just as friendly and sincere in person as she had been in print, she was not particularly adventurous. Her favourite pastime was to spend the day in bed rereading the works of Charles Dickens, whoever he was. And what’s more, the young lady’s household had a sense of propriety that made life in the Watson house seem like a ride at the county fair. Take their tradition of tea. In theory, the notion of an afternoon snack, which includes a variety of tasty treats that you can freely choose from, should be music to a whimsical ear. But in practice, afternoon tea at the Abernathy house was something quite different. It was regimented in terms of the hour it was held, the food that was served and the manner in which your teacup was supposed to be raised to your lips. Arriving a few minutes late generally prompted an admonishment, the slurping of your tea resulted in a reprimand, and the placing of strawberry jam on top of a cucumber sandwich was absolutely forbidden!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what was the tenor of English scholarship? Well, if Ellie’s whimsy thought grammar received undue attention in Nebraska, he was shocked – utterly shocked, I tell you – to find that the British grammatical primer was twice as long as the American one, despite having much smaller print.

&lt;p&gt;Then, nearly three months after the whimsy’s arrival, Abigail’s class was given a reprieve from the rigours of the academy by going on a field trip to see the changing of the guard at St James’s Palace; and as it happened, this was the very day that the King came to formally review those regiments that were entrusted with the defence of his well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excited by the resulting pomp and circumstance, every member of Abigail’s class stood on their tiptoes to see over the shoulders of the tourists. But Ellie’s whimsy, having watched the rigmarole for a few minutes and gotten the general idea, began aimlessly looking about, until he spied a Rolls-Royce parked at the edge of the crowd with its door open. Naturally, Ellie’s whimsy had never seen the inside of a Rolls-Royce; but seeing the inside of a Rolls-Royce struck Ellie’s whimsy as just the sort of thing one should do without fail if given the chance. Breaking from his group, he weaved through the crowd and slipped inside – only to be joined a few minutes later by King Edward himself who, having instructed his chauffeur to return to Buckingham Palace, sat back and sighed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellie’s whimsy had always thought of himself as one who knew a thing or two about the vicissitudes of the human heart. He was a whimsy of the world, as it were. But he was utterly taken aback by King Edward’s sigh. For in his experience, a sigh was something one expressed when one finds that one is doing something that one has no inclination to do. And yet, wasn’t the very definition of being a king that one could do whatever one wanted at the drop of the royal hat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting finer formalities aside, Ellie’s whimsy stuck out his hand, introduced himself, and expressed his surprise that a king, of all people, should utter such a sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ah,” said the King, with a mournful shake of the head. Then he explained to the whimsy that as heir to the throne, his entire life had been circumscribed by requirements of Court. Longstanding protocols dictated not only what he should do, but when he should do it, how he should do it, and even what attire he should do it in. Here the King gestured to the buttons and medals that festooned the royal jacket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is as if, on the day you were born, you were handed a giant diary with a detailed account of that which was going to happen to you for the remainder of your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No wonder the poor fellow looks so grim,” thought the whimsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the King went on to explain the small matter of his affection for the American divorcée and the unanimous opinion held by his family, the members of parliament and the Archbishop of Canterbury that he must put this love behind him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is one to do?” asked the King, rhetorically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the whimsy, who was relatively deaf to rhetoric, assumed the King had asked his question in earnest. And without a moment’s hesitation, he told the King exactly what one is to do under such a circumstance, going so far as to bolster his case with a few romantic lines from Shakespeare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, perhaps, Miss Penniworth had been right, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Ellie recognised her whimsy’s handiwork in the actions of the King, as if woken from a slumber, she realised that the life she had been leading without her whimsy was not her own. “He must have slipped into that letter back in September,” she thought to herself. “But what to do about it now…?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As fate would have it, at the very moment she was asking herself this question, she was staring at the back of her Corn Crispies box. And there, in a bright yellow square, was a special announcement from the Corn Crispies Corporation of America. To celebrate the brand’s new motto – Even Christopher Columbus Ate Corn Crispies – the company was awarding an all-expenses-paid trip to Europe to whomever submitted the most Corn Crispies box tops by the 1st of June!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, should Ellie Watson have set out to win this promotional contest just six months before, she would never have stood a chance. For, having initiated the effort with a youthful enthusiasm, before she had accumulated even 10 box tops, she probably would have been distracted by some other noble inclination – such as the chasing of the rooster in the barnyard, or the reading of a Hardy Boys mystery while hanging upside down from a tree limb. But that was the old Ellie. Ever since the affixing of the stamp, Ellie had not only the pragmatic vision, but the tireless determination necessary to see through an endeavour of this magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the second day of her venture, Ellie saw that the prize would never be hers based upon her own consumption of Corn Crispies, even were she to eat them for breakfast, lunch and dinner. That afternoon, she began knocking on the doors of her neighbours, and then her neighbours’ neighbours, asking if they happened to have any Corn Crispie box tops to spare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the weeks that followed, as Ellie worked her way from house to house, her mother and father expressed their full support. Having spent their entire lives on farms where one succeeded solely by the sweat of one’s brow, they recognised the virtues of industry and persistence. That Ellie should set out on such a daunting endeavour with such determination, at so young an age, struck them as a very promising sign, especially as she had been so whimsical as a child. Of course, they had no expectation that their daughter would win a trip to anywhere. After all, there were not enough box tops in all of Hallelujah County for someone to win a nationally advertised contest. But in the Watsons’ opinion, the fact that their daughter had no chance of winning simply added to the value of the lesson: that one should try one’s hardest, even when the chances for victory are slim; and then take pride that one has given the venture one’s all, even when one fails to emerge victorious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determined to show their support for their daughter, the Watsons did not draw her attention to the insufficiency of box tops in the county; but Ellie came to the same conclusion soon enough. For once on the outskirts of Aurora, the farmhouses were miles apart and, in many cases, the families didn’t even eat cereal. So, for the second time in this story, Ellie sent a fateful letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one was to her brother, Tom, who – having enlisted in the army the previous spring – was going through basic training at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. In the letter, Ellie expressed her desire to go to Europe, explained the nature of the contest, and wondered if, by any chance, Corn Crispies were eaten at Fort Bragg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although in reading the letter, Tom was somewhat taken aback by the correctness of his sister’s grammar and the neatness of her script, he recognised the old spark which had so often prompted her to do the unexpected. Like any young man with a soft spot in his heart for his younger sister, Tom adopted Ellie’s mission as his own. He told all the boys in the barracks about the contest, who in turn told the boys in the neighbouring barracks, until the word had spread to every single regiment on the base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happened, not only was the Corn Crispies Corporation of America an authorised supplier to the US Army, the enlisted men at Fort Bragg were allowed to eat as many bowls of cereal as they could stomach in the 18 minutes they were given for breakfast. So, once the word had gone out that Corn Crispie box tops were needed to send a young Nebraskan on an all-expenses-paid trip to Europe, let’s just say that over hill and over dale, as they hit the dusty trail, those caissons went rolling along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on the 23rd of May, just one week before the deadline of the contest, as Mr and Mrs Watson looked on in dumb amazement, a convoy of four US Army trucks draped in dark green canvas rolled into the Watson farm bearing 20,000 Corn Crispie box tops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let that be a lesson to you, parents and children alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of sending a 16-year-old girl to Europe un¬accompanied was contrary to the instincts, upbringing and moral education of the Watsons. (Never mind the question of who was going to do her chores in her absence!) But having encouraged their daughter in this endeavour, having sung the praises of endurance and persistence, having even gone so far as to paraphrase a Biblical passage or two, when Ellie actually won the trip, there was nothing for them to do but give her a few pieces of parting advice and ask her to write. And on the 25th of June, with her brand new suitcase in hand, Ellie took the train to New York where she boarded the Queen Mary for the transatlantic crossing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she crossed the ocean, Ellie did not think at any great length about what she would do upon her arrival in London. This is not because she was careless. Rather, in that fine Nebraskan fashion, her course of action had seemed to speak for itself: upon her arrival, she would take a taxi to Buckingham Palace, ask to see Edward, and explain to him that, through no fault of his own, he had come into possession of a whimsy that wasn’t his.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is exactly what she did – at least, the part about the taxi and the asking for Edward. But much to Ellie’s consternation, the soldiers standing at attention in front of the palace’s gates wouldn’t even deign to respond to her enquiry. Finding this behaviour utterly unacceptable, Ellie hailed a constable who in turn tried to explain that the royal guard were not accustomed to admitting tourists to the royal palace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tourists!” cried Ellie in indignation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when she launched into a heated description of the evidence that a certain king of a certain country had come into possession of a whimsy that wasn’t his, rather than debate the integrity of the House of Windsor, the constable attempted to politely bring the dispute to its conclusion by pointing to a newsstand and noting that the abdicated king was currently in Gay Paree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, when Ellie picked up the latest issue of Tatler, on the cover she found a photograph of Edward and Mrs Simpson enjoying themselves at a table for two under the canopy of the Café de la Rotonde, on the corner of Boulevard du Montparnasse and Boulevard Raspail.

&lt;p&gt;“Taxi!” called Ellie with a hand in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellie arrived at La Rotonde on a Tuesday night at nine. Seeing no sign of her whimsy in the seats outside, she entered the restaurant proper with its cushions of red velvet, amber lighting and walls lined with portraits. Taking a seat at a table for two, Ellie signalled a waiter – who had just delivered a serving of foie gras to the tall, balding man dining alone in the corner booth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you speak English?” Ellie asked the waiter, hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oui,” he admitted, begrudgingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Were you working the night the abdicated king was here?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Of course.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking heart, Ellie asked if on that night, he had happened to see a whimsy in the café who was about her height and clean-shaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waiter rolled his eyes and responded that if he was given a franc for every whimsy that had entered the doors of La Rotonde, he would be dining on foie gras rather than delivering it. Then he continued on to the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even as Ellie was feeling her spirits sink, the tall, balding man from the corner booth appeared at her table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Excuse me,” he said with a resonant voice. “Are you an American?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am,” said Ellie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I thought so.” Then gesturing to the empty seat at Ellie’s table, he asked if he might join her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Ellie’s parents had given her their pieces of parting advice, the very first piece was to fend off any enquiries from unfamiliar men. But this stranger, who must have been 75 years old, struck her as a gentleman; and what’s more, after admitting that he had inadvertently overheard her conversation with the waiter, he said he might be of some assistance in her quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please,” she said, offering him the empty seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gentleman, whose name was Harry Mathews, was actually an American. Born into a prominent family and educated in the Ivy League, Mr Mathews’s future in New York had been promising, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But like you,” he said, “I had the desire to see the world…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, rather than join the Knickerbocker Club, he joined the navy, and entered upon a peripatetic life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, I have travelled far and wide, my friend. Though I have long maintained a small apartment here – just around the corner – one week I might shoot off to Vienna and the next to Madrid. I know most of the conductors on the European railways by name. I have explored the Greek isles by boat, traversed the Sahara by camel, and crossed the Dolomites by hydrogen balloon. I once even travelled across Croatia in a gypsy caravan! So enamoured with the roving life was I, when I arrived in a new city, I would always stay at the hotel closest to the station, so that at a moment’s notice I could be on the very next train to wherever my wanderlust took me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mr Mathews recalled the adventures of his prime, his eyes grew bright and misty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ah, the people I have known,” he said with a shake of the head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then his voice grew deeper, graver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This July, it was my intention to take advantage of the long days by revisiting some of my favourite cities in Italy. After taking the ferry from Marseille to Ostia, I planned to begin in Rome, then make my way to Florence, and from Florence to Venice… But a few nights ago, with my bags already packed and my passport in hand, I came here for one more meal before setting out. And as I sat at one of the outside tables – watching the Montparnassens cross Raspail and Raspailans cross Montparnasse – I suddenly felt the desire to remain exactly where I was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked out into the intersection for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who can explain it? Perhaps it was the raindrops falling on the canopy, or the streetlamp flickering on the corner, or the empty oyster shells resting on my plate, but suddenly I thought: this is where I belong. And what an extraordinary revelation that is, my dear, as you will no doubt discover in your own time. But even as I was coming to this conclusion, I had the awareness that my wanderlust had left me…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellie leaned back in her chair, seeing it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With my whimsy,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes,” he replied, “with your whimsy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Mathews explained how after the visit of the abdicated King, her whimsy had begun frequenting the café and on more than one occasion had joined him and his wanderlust for a late supper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But then, on the night of my epiphany, as I was suddenly lost in reflection, my wanderlust excused himself. Only half attentive, I watched as he crossed the café and pulled up a chair at your whimsy’s table. Together they ordered a round of Chartreuse. They whispered like conspirators and laughed like old friends. And 20 minutes later, they were gone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Did they say where they were going?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Mathews shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I never had the chance to ask. But in all the time that we were together, not once did my wanderlust fail to follow through on a journey we had planned. As such, I would say with near certainty that the two are headed for Rome…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Ellie nodded and pulled back her chair, Mr Mathews produced a tall leather billfold from which he withdrew his tickets for the train to Marseille and the ferry to Ostia, along with 15,000 lire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Here,” he said. “Take these. They are no longer of use to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellie thanked the old man and even gave him a parting kiss on the cheek. But as she walked away from the table, Mr Mathews called out “Wait!” as if he’d suddenly remembered one last detail upon which the whole enterprise hinged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes?” said Ellie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Be advised, my dear, that your whimsy is no longer clean-shaven! He now wears a goatee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Ellie emerged from the terminus in Rome, she was immediately confronted by a quandary: now that she was here, what was she to do? If, in fact, all roads lead to Rome, then it seemed axiomatic that all roads must lead away from it as well. But in which direction should she venture? Would her whimsy and Mr Mathews’s wanderlust head into the countryside, or would they visit the traditional sites of the city? Should she go the Colosseum or the Sistine Chapel and hope to find them among the throngs of tourists? But even as she looked out across the traffic in this state of uncertainty, her gaze lit upon the entrance of an international hotel not a thousand feet away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Of course!” she said to herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why hadn’t she thought of it before? Mr Mathews had explicitly informed her that he always stayed in the hotel closest to the train station, so that he could be ready to leave at a moment’s notice. Surely, his wanderlust would live by the same cardinal rule. Dodging traffic, Ellie dashed across the street and through the doors of the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon entering the lobby, Ellie felt a pang of disappointment; for everyone in sight seemed to be acting just as you’d expect them to act. There were tourists taking last looks at Baedekers before heading out to pursue the day’s itinerary without the slightest emendation. Bellhops were taking the luggage of new arrivals to the rooms that had been requested months before. And those settling their bill exhibited no expression of adverse surprise when they surveyed the itemised charges, having successfully lived within their budgets despite the hotel’s temptations and the inevitable mistakes that one is bound to make when calculating exchange rates in one’s head. Which is to say, no one in the lobby seemed the least affected by a whim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when she approached the concierge’s desk to ask if there were other hotels in the immediate vicinity, Ellie found a harried young man who was talking into two separate phones at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Si. No. No. Si. Grazie. Grazie. Prego. Prego.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he hung them both up and Ellie asked about the other hotels in the area, he rolled his eyes and threw up his hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How should I know what other hotels are in the area?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But aren’t you the concierge?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do I look like the concierge?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a flurry of Italian and English (with a bit of German cursing thrown in for good measure), the harried young man, who turned out to be the assistant to the assistant manager, explained that after 15 years of service, Signor Raisanetti, the hotel’s concierge, had quit his job on Thursday night without notice. And why had he quit? Not in some dispute with management over compensation; and not because he had received a competing offer from a competing hotel; rather, after helping two Americans with their train reservations, Signor Raisanetti walked into the manager’s office and submitted his resignation – so that he could pursue his dream of singing in the opera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And as a tenor, no less!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellie’s eyes widened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Were they headed to Florence?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Was who headed to Florence?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The two Americans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, yes,” he said with another roll of the eyes. “They were headed to Florence. The birthplace of the Renaissance. The Athens of the Middle Ages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the two phones on the desk began ringing again and the assistant to the assistant manager raised one to each ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Buongiorno! Buongiorno!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon receiving the news that she was late once again, another traveller might have become dispirited, feeling that surely the Fates were lined up against her. But just as Sherlock Holmes, having experienced a minor setback, would dash out the door with his deerstalker on his head and the pronouncement that the game was afoot, Ellie left the hotel with renewed determination. For having been one step behind her whimsy ever since crossing the Atlantic, Ellie had decided it was time to be one step ahead. Rather than take the train to Florence, she would fly straight to Venice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Ellie was not one step ahead of her whimsy. For despite the Uffizi, the Duomo and the Palazzo Vecchio, despite the Laurentian Library and the frescoes of Fra Angelico in the Convent of San Marco, Ellie’s whimsy had spent less than 24 hours in the city of Florence. Even as Ellie’s plane was approaching Marco Polo Airport, her whimsy was sitting in Harry’s Bar just off the Grand Canal, in the highest of spirits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why was her whimsy in such a good mood? First, having stumbled upon this improbably named restaurant and finding it crowded, the last-minute cancellation of a reservation had resulted in his being swept to a table upstairs. Then, when his waiter approached, having just spoken to a table of American tourists in perfect English, he addressed Ellie’s whimsy in Italian. (What do you think of that, Aurora, Nebraska!) And finally, there was the food. After being welcomed with a concoction of peach juice and champagne, Ellie’s whimsy was brought a tagliolini tossed with shrimp and zucchini followed by seared halibut in an orange sauce.

&lt;p&gt;Peach juice and champagne? Shrimp and zucchini? Halibut and oranges? Surely, the chef was making it all up as he went along!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving the restaurant in a state of satisfaction, Ellie’s whimsy thought a ride in a gondola might be a nice way to spend an hour; but hearing a café orchestra tuning in the distance, he followed the sound and ended up on the Piazza San Marco, where he took a seat at a table near the string section with a perfect view of the basilica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ah, Venice,” said the whimsy, as so many had before. Then the waiter approached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Buonasera, signore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Buonasera.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Will you be dining with us?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m afraid I have already dined.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then perhaps some gelato…?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You tempt me,” said the whimsy with a smile. “But I think I shall just have an espresso.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Right away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no sooner were these words out of the waiter’s mouth than someone came bounding up with a shout of “There you are!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waiter and whimsy both looked up in surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wanderlust!” said whimsy. “I was just ordering an espresso. Why don’t you join me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An espresso sounds delightful,” said wanderlust. “And on any other night, I’d be the first to accept your offer. But I’m afraid we haven’t the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whimsy looked at wanderlust with a measure of disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Haven’t the time for an espresso?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whimsy gestured toward the piazza, which admittedly had a 400-year-old clock tower in a position of prominence, but which in no other respect would ever suggest that there was not enough time for an espresso – never mind that the very word espresso made it perfectly clear that to drink it would hardly take any time at all. On this particular piazza at this particular hour, you could tell without fear of contradiction that there was time for everything. You could tell it from the pace of the locals who were strolling arm in arm. You could tell it from the orchestra which had just struck up a waltz by Strauss. Even the clouds over the Basilica seemed stalled in their progress by divine intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having gestured to indicate all of this, Ellie’s whimsy smiled and said: “What could possibly be the rush?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with the flourish of a magician, wanderlust produced a fan of papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Believe it or not,” he announced with a grin, “I have just secured us a private berth on the Orient Express. And it leaves in 13 minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Orient Express…” whimsy said with a hint of disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Exactly!” said wanderlust. “Belgrade, Sofia, Istanbul…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But we’ve only just arrived.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you mean only just arrived?” said wanderlust. “We got here last night.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Got here last night?” exclaimed the whimsy. “But that’s my point, exactly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No,” countered wanderlust, “that’s my point, exactly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a moment, wanderlust stared at whimsy, and whimsy stared right back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, they had not known each other for very long. But when they had met at La Rotonde, it had seemed to Ellie’s whimsy (who had grown a little tired of spending time on his own) that here might be the perfect travelling companion – a fellow who was always ready upon a moment’s notice to head off on some new adventure. So, the night in the café when wanderlust had suggested that the two set off on a tour of Italy, he hadn’t hesitated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem, as whimsy soon discovered, was that wanderlust was always ready to head off on some new adventure. When they arrived in Marseille to make the crossing to Rome, what whimsy saw before him was a city with hundreds of idiosyncratic neighbourhoods and a thousand little junctures at which point the spirited traveller, intending to go right, could suddenly go left to great advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, before the night was out, wanderlust was ready to pack his bags. Not impulsively, you understand; not because the spirit had moved him; but because it was “time to go”. Wanderlust’s desire to move from one city to the next was almost as predictable as the railway timetables that he kept in his pocket. So inevitable was his desire to get up and go, that it verged on tyranny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsure of what to do, whimsy turned his gaze from wanderlust to the waiter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waiter, who had his pad and pencil still in hand, simply raised his eyebrows, as much as to say: Do you want the espresso, or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then whimsy turned from the waiter back to wanderlust who, with their tickets in hand, raised his eyebrows, as much as to say: Belgrade, Sofia, Istanbul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waltz the orchestra had been playing suddenly came to a close. The pigeons that had been milling about the café suddenly took flight. And Ellie’s whimsy, letting his shoulders drop, turned back to the waiter and cancelled his coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amelia Earhart once said that when she first went up in a plane at the age of 23, she had that rarest of experiences: the sensing of astonishment and familiarity at the very same moment. On the one hand, she was astounded to find herself 10,000 feet above the surface of the earth, but on the other, she felt so at home in the cockpit, it was as if she’d been flying all of her life. As I say, such an experience is rare. In fact, it may only happen once or twice. But when it does, pay close attention, because your life is about to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, this is the sensation that Ellie Watson felt as her water taxi skipped across the waves and the city of Venice came into view. On the one hand, she was in a state of amazement that over a thousand years ago, a group of sailors and merchants had decided to build a city on the surface of the Adriatic Sea. And yet, at some essential level, Ellie thought: of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the suggestion of the water taxi’s driver, Ellie went straight to the Hotel Danieli, which was just a few hundred feet down the quay from the city’s central landing. When Ellie approached the front desk in order to check in, she also described the two friends who would soon be arriving from Florence, and asked that she be notified at once upon their arrival. But the desk captain said this would not be necessary. Because he knew exactly who she was referring to; and having arrived from Florence the previous day, the two had checked out not 15 minutes before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, does destiny takes us from highs to lows. Having just felt the transcendence of being in a place that was at once astonishing and familiar, upon discovering that she had missed her whimsy once again, Ellie felt distressed, distraught and dismayed. (Oh, what a dispiriting prefix!) Since Mr Mathews had only described his planned itinerary as far as Venice, Ellie had no idea where her whimsy might go next. And for the first time, she was forced to acknowledge that she might never see her whimsy again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if in a dream, she wandered out of the Danieli and along the quay, blindly falling in step with the evening’s foot traffic as it spilled onto St Mark’s Square. Coming to a stop in the centre of the piazza, Ellie turned around, conscious that all the people passing by were on their way to shops or museums, dinners or performances, assignations or vespers – which is to say, headed somewhere for some reason. But it seemed to Ellie that she had only one place left to go, and that was to Aurora, Nebraska, where y=2x+2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When suddenly, one hundred pigeons that were milling about the tables of a nearby café took flight all at once. In a flurry, they wheeled around the Campanile and returned to where they had started, only to take flight a moment later and make the same journey around the old bell tower, but in the opposite direction. And as Ellie watched them settling back on the stones around the café tables, she said aloud: “He’s here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we last left Ellie’s whimsy, he had just cancelled his coffee in a state of resignation. After all, hadn’t he always hoped to see Budapest one day? And didn’t his travelling companion already have their tickets in hand? But as whimsy stood from the table, ready to follow wanderlust to the station, he noted that the nearby flock of pigeons that had taken flight and wheeled around the bell tower twice, were now settling once again in their spot beside the café.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes,” thought the whimsy. “That is it exactly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, having sent wanderlust on his way, Ellie’s whimsy returned to his table, signalled the waiter, and ordered a gelato – just as his oldest friend in the world emerged inexplicably from the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the very next day, when Ellie stopped at the concierge’s desk at the Danieli to send a postcard home, rather than purchase one 25-lire stamp, she purchased 25 one-lira stamps, and once she’d affixed them all over the card, there was just enough space to assure her parents that she was well, but not enough to indicate when she might be coming home.&lt;/p&gt;
